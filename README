# Fun Finder!

[Visit Live Site](https://funfinderapp.herokuapp.com/#/)

Fun Finder is an interactive MERN-stack web app that allows users to find places to go.
By narrowing categories, we utilized Google Places API to filter out based
on a place's 'type' property, ie. bar, cafe, tourist_attraction, etc. Then, after clicking 'Find me a place!',
the website randomly selects a place to go to. The random search result will then render the location's marker
on our colorful map (achieved with Google Maps API) as well as the location's name and address.

## Randomizing Functions

We were able to tap into the searchbar autocomplete functionality within Places API
in order to have search results available that are filtered based on the types category.
